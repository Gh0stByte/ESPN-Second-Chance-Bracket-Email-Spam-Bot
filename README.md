# ESPN Second Chance Bracket March Madness Emailing Spam Bot - Python
This is a bot I made in Python to spam the members of my Bracket with ESPN's email group function.
It will read through a list and send an email every 20 (configurable) seconds. Currently it's set up with Shakespear's Julius Caesar.
