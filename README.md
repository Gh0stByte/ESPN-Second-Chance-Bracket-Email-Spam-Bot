# ESPN Second Chance Bracket March Madness Emailing Spam Bot - Python
This is a bot I made in Python to spam the members of my Bracket with ESPN's email group function.
It will read through a list and send an email every 20 (configurable) seconds. Currently it's set up with Shakespear's Julius Caesar.

## Usage
 - Download [Bot](ESPN%20Email%20Spam%20Bot.py)
 - Configure in the Config section
 - Let it run
